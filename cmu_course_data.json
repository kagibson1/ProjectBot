During that lecture, he had declared drawing dead for architects-this despite the fact that the most compelling explanations he made during his talk were done with rather good gestural drawings.  It had seemed to me that the work he showed lacked formal order, complexity, scale and proportion (goo would be a good word for my sense of it), and I have speculated ever since that a course in classical anatomy would be helpful in addressing those weaknesses in their idiom.  Closer to home, I began to think it would be important for our students because they (as all students do) will tend to pursue the formal clichs of our time: Maynes, Patrick Schumacher etc.    In effect, there is an assumption behind this course: that through drawing that focuses consciously upon the formal order of real organic conditions, we can come to assimilate a sense of that order in a way that can make it ultimately transferrable to design.

Examples include investing in and developing new products or technology, expanding/reducing manufacturing capacity, and suspending/resuming production. The valuation of financial options is the conceptual basis of real options management (but this course does not assume prior knowledge of this topic). Real options analysis extends this fundamental market-driven valuation approach to a much broader spectrum of business applications that feature dynamic decision-making. It thus contrasts the standard net present value rule used by static discounted cash flow analysis.

Today, the need to entertain and pay the bills persists, yet it is set within a (mostly) nonprofit landscape in which performing arts organizations produce works to transform audiences via one or several intersecting art forms.  Producing a successful season entails selection (planning) and implementation (managing) of programs, something that is neither easy nor consistent.  Driving and complicating the situation is the usual bifurcated management structure.  Managers must find a way to implement the vision an Artistic Director - an individual with an aesthetic framework. Arts managers enable his or her artistic vision within the context of the physical, geographical and financial situation of a company.  Combining and mixing these forces is frequently messy and always an adventure.  Organizational history provides some structures to the process, but each season brings new artistic and managerial challenges against a backdrop of a rapidly changing society. If a career of doing the same thing is the goal then a different field might be recommended.      This course will examine approaches to producing a performing arts season of programming with an emphasis on the nonprofit season structure.  Over 7 short weeks we will attempt to answer the following question: How do managers move an organization mission through an artistic vision set across a selection of programs and create a system to manage the process and evaluate both artistic success but community impact and mission-centric strategic goals?

In a time of big data and widespread skepticism of science, it is crucial to understand how data and facts can be turned into conclusions, and then into public policy. Using topics from medicine, epidemiology, and public health, this course provides students an introduction into the grand challenge of understanding how evidence is used (and abused) in support of scientific conclusions. Questions of health and disease are particularly important areas for thinking about facts and figures because many life-or-death decisions have to be made on the basis of fragmentary and unreliable evidence. Every trip to the doctor, illness, and vaccination involves a complicated mix of public policy, scientific evidence, and emotional and historical factors. This course helps students understand the sciences and the humanities as united in their desire for rigorous argumentation rather than as competing or incompatible ways of thinking. Moreover, by taking a wide-angle lens to the topic, students will see how and why standards of scientific proof have changed over time, and track what these changes mean for thinking about evidence. Co-taught by a statistician and historian, this course draws on many different disciplines, providing students a broad introduction to reasoning across the humanities and social sciences.  Students will be required to participate in written and oral arguments, read scientific articles as well as political, historical, and legal documents, and prepare a capstone project in which they will be asked to weigh real-life evidence and recommend a course of action to the Food and Drug Administration.

Shelleys novel warns of the possible sacrifices for knowledge and hints toward the costs to man and society, how new knowledge can redefine human existence and experience. Science and technology have rapidly advanced Shelleys time; sometimes too quickly for creators to fully consider the ramifications of new discoveries. As science fiction literature and media have matured over the past two hundred years, the themes of Frankenstein have been reinterpreted and applied to debates regarding atomic weapons, nuclear energy, cloning, bioengineering, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI). Isaac Asimov coined the term Frankenstein Complex in his 1947 robot stories to not only warn of humanitys tenuous control over technology, but also to caution against the profit-based replacement of human labor with automation. It is the humanoid android and the cyborg that blends man and machine that evokes the most dire warnings in todays renderings of the Frankenstein Complex.

These working groups create projects over the course of the semester which are shown in informal presentations.  The emphasis is on process, not product -- devising an interdisciplinary performance requires a keen focus on combining creative invention with a rigorous structure of concept development -- both of which are explored here.

In addition, these analog interfaces appear in sensors (e.g., accelerometer). The goal of this course is to familiarize students with some of the advanced analog circuit design ideas that are involved in these tasks.

Significant effort is placed on understanding how to design randomized experiments (aka A/B tests) to measure causal effects. We also discuss the most common challenges that arise when trying to design such experiments in the wild and in network settings.

This course will have two main objectives: (1) to help you develop a repertoire of stylistic options and a critical vocabulary for discussing those options, and (2) to give you the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice when revising writing. Two recurring questions for us will be the following: if style depends on both the rhetorical situation of a text and knowledge of specific guidelines, how can we ever say that we have achieved good style? Should stylistic rules or practical experience carry more weight in the decisions we make as writers?", "prereqs": "(76-101) or (76-102) or (76-106 and 76-107) or (76-107 and 76-108) or (76-106 and 76-108)", "prereqs_obj": {"invert": true, "reqs_list": [["76-101"], ["76-102"], ["76-106", "76-107"], ["76-107", "76-108"], ["76-106", "76-108"]]}, "coreqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "name": "Style", "units": 9.0, "department": "English", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [2, 4], "begin": "10:30AM", "end": "11:50AM", "building": "PH", "room": "226A", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "A", "instructors": ["Larson, Stephanie"]}, {"times": [{"days": [0, 2], "begin": "04:30PM", "end": "05:50PM", "building": "CMB", "room": "3044", "location": "Doha, Qatar"}], "name": "W", "instructors": ["Mitchell, Thomas"]}], "sections": []}, "76-391": {"desc": "Today, many professionals are responsible for the visual design of documents.

We tend to think of totalitarian regimes where the State controls information and prohibits the expression of dissenting views. We also tend to associate propaganda with certain rhetorical techniques - highly emotional words, deceptive representations, and glittering generalities that inhibit rational thought and manipulate public opinion. According to such popular views, propaganda is linked to the dissemination of false information and is antithetical to the norms of democratic society. Our class will challenge these assumptions. First, instead of confining propaganda to authoritarian governments, we will examine how propaganda functions within democratic society. Indeed, we will focus on domestic propaganda in America, especially political propaganda but also propaganda in advertising and public relations. Next, instead of focusing exclusively on deceptive rhetorical techniques, we will ask a more elemental question: What enables propaganda to circulate? Answering this question will force us to consider the routines and values of corporate media as well as the power relations that give some people special access to channels of mass communication. Certainly, we will also examine propaganda messages themselves, attending to manipulative tactics as well as rhetorical strategies used to induce uptake in the mainstream press. We begin our seminar by studying key theories of propaganda, looking at primary texts for various definitions and criticisms of the concept. We will then examine how powerful institutions, especially media organizations, manage the dissemination of propaganda in democracies.

This course combines technical, economic, legal, and policy perspectives to present a holistic view of its role and value in the digital age.  The reduction of the cost of storing and manipulating information has led organizations to capture increasing amounts of information about individual behavior. New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive.

Historically, radios were hardware-dependent and fixed to a specific signal waveform. Your modern smartphone implements several individual radios (2G, 3G, 4G, WiFi, GPS, FM radio, Bluetooth, etc). A software-defined radio would adapt to these different waveforms and receive all of them with one radio. In this course, we will study the end-to-end processes involved in radio transmitters and receivers (or transceivers) such as modulation/demodulation, coding/decoding, amplification, etc. Using a physical device to implement the front-end of the receiver, we will design the other processes in software; for example, we can design an FM software-defined receiver to receive existing FM radio signals in Kigali.

The core models of microeconomics are fundamental to more applied areas of management such as strategy, marketing, production, and finance.

How does France strive to achieve greater equality among its diverse population? To what extent are these efforts successful? In order to understand the nuances and complexity of these phenomena, we will approach them through a variety of topics: the French educational system, the labor market, the situation of refugees and its implications for French society, and the French welfare system, including access to healthcare and social protection.

FALL 2018:(Post)Apocalyptic visions are metaphors for the human condition and may often be an expression of political turmoil or social and cultural fears. Their evolution and meaning can be explored and traced to a current complex lexicon pointing to science, technology, globalism, and humankind as catalysts for the end of the world. How are discussions about the end of the world framed in Latin America? What is the relationship between the monstrous  popular fear? What parts of humanity remain when death is rampant and social structures have broken down? How can these visions address social and environmental changes, and the possible future human outcomes of these changes? In pursuit of answers to these questions, the course will be an exploration of written and visual narratives used to contain and explain threats pertaining to Latin America and/or created from within its diffuse borders, with an emphasis on texts produced after the second half of the 20th century.

In the culture, which values and emphasizes conformity, the phenomenon is utterly unprecedented.  Accordingly, in this course, we will first explore the defining features of these anomalies  by examining how Japanese youth are portrayed in modern day fictions and films.  We will then scrutinize the extent to which these portrayals actually reflect real lives of young Japanese by analyzing newspaper articles and essays commenting on the social issues surrounding them.  Finally, we will take a close look at the dramatic social changes, over the past three decades, to trace their long-term impacts  as a significant factor contributing to the emergence of the new culture, particularly with respect to the changing youth behaviors.

The common view that mathematics - if not directly static, it evolves in a linear fashion - does not withstand historical scrutiny. Indeed, there are many dramatic conceptual developments concerning the very nature and object of mathematics.  We examine three episodes in the relatively recent past that reflect a radical transformation of the subject. They are closely associated with three mathematicians in whose work those revolutionary changes come to the fore most poignantly.  The three episodes are framed by a discussion, at the beginning, of the axiomatic method and, at the end, of contemporary computational models of mathematical thinking. The episodes fall within the period from 1854 to 1954, but have deep roots in the past. The first episode deals with the shift from geometry to arithmetic as the foundational discipline for mathematics. The accompanying change in the methodological perspective is expressed in Hilberts Foundations of Geometry, the center of the second episode. When joined with contemporaneous logical developments, that perspective underlies the formalization of mathematics. Gdels incompleteness theorems imposed theoretical limits on that work.

The common view that mathematics - if not directly static, it evolves in a linear fashion - does not withstand historical scrutiny. Indeed, there are many dramatic conceptual developments concerning the very nature and object of mathematics.  We examine three episodes in the relatively recent past that reflect a radical transformation of the subject. They are closely associated with three mathematicians in whose work those revolutionary changes come to the fore most poignantly.  The three episodes are framed by a discussion, at the beginning, of the axiomatic method and, at the end, of contemporary computational models of mathematical thinking. The episodes fall within the period from 1854 to 1954, but have deep roots in the past. The first episode deals with the shift from geometry to arithmetic as the foundational discipline for mathematics. The accompanying change in the methodological perspective is expressed in Hilberts Foundations of Geometry, the center of the second episode. When joined with contemporaneous logical developments, that perspective underlies the formalization of mathematics. Gdels incompleteness theorems imposed theoretical limits on that work.  However, given Turings analysis of computations, the question remains, how much of mathematical reasoning can be accomplished by computing machines.

Peirce responded by constructing a comprehensive philosophy emphasizing the scientific importance of community, fallibility, and action.

The primary objective of the course is to familiarize students with the microeconomic paradigm and develop an appreciation of the usefulness (and limitations) of microeconomic analysis. A further goal of the course is to develop and exercise students ability to use economic analysis in examining applied issues and more generally to help students acquire formal modeling skills -- the ability to reduce real-world problems to useful and mathematically tractable representations.    This course is designed for the following students: (i) Ph.D. students who want to increase their exposure to microeconomics but do not expect to use formal microeconomics in their research (i.e. students for whom this course is likely to be their last course in microeconomics); (ii) Ph.D. students who plan to study microeconomics beyond the introductory level of this course but do not have the background for the microeconomic sequence offered at GSIA; and (iii) M.S. students who have an especially strong background in mathematics. Notice that this course is not a close substitute for the first course in the Tepper microeconomics sequence. Students who want to take more advanced microeconomics courses and who have the preparation are encouraged to investigate the courses offered at Tepper.  There are no formal prerequisites for this course. However, students are assumed to have a solid working knowledge of multivariate calculus. You will take a brief math quiz in the first lecture to help you determine whether your math training is sufficient for the course.

computation.  The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.  The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches.

They are difficult to visualize, and it is difficult to understand what sort of errors and biases are present in them. They are computationally expensive to process, and often the cost of learning is hard to predict - for instance, and algorithm that runs quickly in a dataset that fits in memory may be exorbitantly expensive when the dataset is too large for memory. Large datasets may also display qualitatively different behavior in terms of which learning methods produce the most accurate predictions.  This course is intended to provide a student practical knowledge of, and experience with, the issues involving large datasets. Among the issues considered are: scalable learning techniques, such as streaming machine learning techniques; parallel infrastructures such as map-reduce; practical techniques for reducing the memory requirements for learning methods, such as feature hashing and Bloom filters; and techniques for analysis of programs in terms of memory, disk usage, and (for parallel methods) communication complexity.  The class will include programming assignments, and a one-month short project chosen by the student.

Features of the approach:   -Builds from first principles  -Compares different approaches  -Stresses fundamental analysis and, in particular, the distinction between operating and financing activities to isolate the value drivers -Exploits accounting as a system for measuring value added   Here is a list of topics we address:   -Which firm activities generate value?   -How do we evaluate earnings quality (persistence)?   -How do we pull apart and reformulate financial statements to get at the relevant information?   -How should we do ratio analysis to reflect the underlying economic activities of the firm?   3. Course organization:  The course uses a combination of lectures, cases, and a take-home final exam.  Your participation in case discussions is a key component of the course", "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "name": "Financial Statement Analysis", "units": 6.0, "department": "Tepper School of Business", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [2, 4], "begin": "10:30AM", "end": "12:15PM", "building": "TEP", "room": "2112", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "A1", "instructors": ["Ruchti, Thomas"]}], "sections": []}, "45-806": {"desc": "Entrepreneurial Alternatives will examine paths of entrepreneurship outside of high-growth, new venture creation.

Determining the price of a product or service is one of the most important marketing decisions. It is also one of the most complex and least understood aspects of marketing. While many marketing activities are geared toward creating value for the customer, sound pricing decisions are the fundamental tool for businesses to capture the value they create. In todays hypercompetitive environment, even slight errors in determining the best price can lead to large financial losses. This course draws on the fundamental disciplines of microeconomics, statistics and psychology to shed light on good pricing practice. It surveys some popular pricing practices, explores their pitfalls, and identifies the fallacies they are based on. The first part of the course discusses the foundations for sound pricing decisions: costs, customer and competition. It then moves on to current pricing strategies, tactics and their applications: pricing over the product life cycle; product line pricing; pricing through the marketing channel; price discrimination; two-part tariffs and nonlinear pricing; price bundling; perceived value pricing; and competitive pricing. The course objectives are (1) to build the right pricing philosophy that guides everyday marketing activities, (2) to introduce a framework, based on concepts drawn from cognitive psychology, economics and industrial organization, to study pricing decisions, and (3) to master some concrete analytical and numerical tools for its successful creation, utilization, and management of sound pricing decisions", "prereqs": null, "prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "name": "Pricing Strategy", "units": 6.0, "department": "Tepper School of Business", "lectures": [{"times": [{"days": [4], "begin": "08:30PM", "end": "09:45PM", "building": null, "room": null, "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "M1", "instructors": ["Boatwright, Peter"]}, {"times": [{"days": [4], "begin": "07:00PM", "end": "08:15PM", "building": null, "room": null, "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania"}], "name": "O1", "instructors": ["Boatwright, Peter"]}], "sections": []}, "45-861": {"desc": "To understand six sigma we must understand its underlying philosophy, that of the modern quality movement.
